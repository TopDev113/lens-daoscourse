# Lens DAOscourse

LFGrow Hackathon - March 18-30, 2022

*Winner of:* ðŸ›  Lens Protocol â€” Best DAO Tooling

### Description
DAOscourse is a DAO Governance dApp leveraging the Lens protocol to create mechanisms to allow contributors to participate to the governance On-Chain and own their contributions

**Github**: https://github.com/FiveElementsLabs/lens-daoscourse

### How it's made

The app uses the Lens protocol to create profiles, follow DAOs, create proposals, comments, share and collect proposals. We used React and Chakra UI to build the frontend. We are using Mumbai Testnet for the moment and soon Polygon. All the intensive part was to leverage what Lens has built so far for profiles creation, following profiles, create posts, comments, and so on.
